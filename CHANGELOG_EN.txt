+ Data export: Data from DataSets/Grids can now be exported to 9 different formats (via right-click on the data).

! EditTableGrid → EditTableData: Migrated to IBX (with array read/write support). Renamed to EditTableData.
! EditDataFullRec removed: Re-implemented as a TabSheet within EditTableData. Now contains 2 tabs: Grid view and Form view. Arrays can also    be edited here (1D arrays tested, 2D arrays not yet). Accessible in the main window by right-clicking on a table name in the TreeView → Edit TableData.

+ New “CheckDBIntegrity” dialog: Displays field CharSets (currently a placeholder – only CharSet check, but easily extendable). Accessible in the main window via the 4th ToolButton in the toolbar.
! Source directory restructured: New structure improves overall clarity.
! Source code revised: Application should now run more stable overall.
