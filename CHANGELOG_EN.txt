TurboBird v1.2.1.1264
Build date & time: 2026-02-16, 20:30:03

+ Activity Monitor (first version) added
  Displays Attachments, Transactions, and Statements
  Attachments can be terminated
  Statements can also be terminated (remain visible until the related attachment ends)
  Accessible via: Right-click on database node → DB-Tools → Activity Monitor
  (This feature is still under development)

+ Tree object filter added
  Simple filter for tree objects
  Container objects (e.g. Packages) remain visible to preserve structure
  Filter performance is fast and stable even with very large databases

! TreeView performance significantly improved
  Faster loading and navigation
  Tested with extremely large databases:
    10,000 Packages (each with multiple subnodes)
    1,000,000 Domains
    several thousand tables
  Tree loading and filtering remain responsive and stable

+ Multiple-file restore fully implemented
  Restore from split backup files is now supported

! ToolButton "TT" re-enabled
  Font name and font size in QueryWindow (Editor) can now be configured via this button
  Editor background color can be configured via INI file
  Editor excluded from ThemeManager to ensure stable and consistent rendering

! Internal improvements and optimizations

* Known issue:
  Server-side restore works reliably and restores large databases completely
  Client-side restore may silently produce incomplete databases
  (issue currently under investigation)
  Recommendation: use server-side restore

TurboBird v1.2.1.1263

Build Date: 2025-12-25
Build Time: 08:56:10

! Complete migration of the application from SQLDB to IBX
  (SQLDB/FPC is no longer used)

+ Support for multiple Firebird server versions within a single TurboBird instance
  (Firebird 2.5, 3.x, 4.x, 5.x, 6.0)

+ Full support for case-sensitive object names
  (tables and fields with mixed-case identifiers)
   Correct handling of quoted and unquoted identifiers
  Context menu in QueryWindow (Ctrl+Space) lists tables and fields correctly
  Case-sensitive names are automatically inserted using double quotes
  (Alias and dot-notation detection not yet implemented – currently intentionally simple)

! Script execution with and without terminators improved
  IBX correctly handles procedure bodies without SET TERM
  Terminators are still added when loading DB objects into the QueryWindow
  (for compatibility with other tools)

+ Integrated Tony Whyman’s IBX Scripter (MWA Software)

! Backup / Restore fully migrated to Tony Whyman’s IBX-based implementation
  More options available (server-side / client-side backups and restores)

! TreeView reworked
  Switched to lazy loading
  Nodes are loaded from the database only when opened for the first time
  Optional refresh behavior configurable via INI file
  Ability to show/hide the TreeView
  (provides more space for query code)

+ QueryWindow improvements
  Code view or result view can be maximized
  Navigator can be shown or hidden via INI file

! Export to Clipboard improved
  Maximum number of exported rows can be limited via INI file
  Prevents accidental copying of very large tables

! Server registration is now mandatory
  Server names are no longer derived from connection strings
  Servers must be resolvable via DNS or the hosts file

! Multi-server handling via IBX
  Loading/unloading of client libraries fully handled by IBX

- Removed custom component SQLDbExt
  (no longer required due to IBX migration)

TurboBird v1.2.1.1262
Build date & time: 26.09.2025, 13:26:00

! Query thread re-enabled
    In Release builds queries are executed in the background
    In Debug builds synchronously (thread disabled)

! For all routines (except package routines) the double-click action was changed to "Edit".

! Tabs:
    ! Captions shortened
    + Tabs are now movable (except Main)
    + TabReiter.Hint shows full info about Firebird object/operation
    + TabReiter now contains an image as visual aid
    An open tab can be reached most easily by double-clicking
    on the navigation tree (tab is brought to the foreground).

! Routine names in the navigation tree standardized
    FBFunctions → Functions
    Stored Procedures → Procedures

Markdown export added

! HTML and Markdown exports improved
    Array contents are now also written into the document

! User PUBLIC hidden

! View Stored Procedure now delivers the complete code of a SP (not only up to AS)

Simple HTML help system created and integrated into the Main Tab
    (HTML viewer currently does not support external links)

! Login procedure changed
    ! First double-click on server node opens login window to connect to the ServiceManager of the Firebird instance
    ! Server information (e.g. version) is retrieved
    + Server login dialog registers servers
    + ServerRegistry dialog for subsequent editing (right-click on server node → ServerRegistry)

! All masks (except simple dialogs and QueryHistory) are now embedded in tabs

! RoutineTester: UDF CSTRINGS are displayed correctly

Firebird version < 3: automatically creates role DUMMYROLE (without rights) and assigns it to new users
    (avoids additional connection to security2.fdb)

Build date & time: 28.08.2025, 11:46:54

+ Data export: Data from DataSets/Grids can now be exported to 9 different formats (via right-click on the data).

+ OpenQueryBuilder integrated: QueryBuilder → IBX interface fixed. With OpenQueryBuilder, queries can be visually created via drag & drop, tested, and transferred into the QueryWindow. Accessible via the last ToolButton in the QueryWindow.
! EditTableGrid → EditTableData: Migrated to IBX (with array read/write support). Renamed to EditTableData.
! EditDataFullRec removed: Re-implemented as a TabSheet within EditTableData. Now contains 2 tabs: Grid view and Form view. Arrays can also    be edited here (1D arrays tested, 2D arrays not yet). Accessible in the main window by right-clicking on a table name in the TreeView → Edit TableData.

+ New “CheckDBIntegrity” dialog: Displays field CharSets (currently a placeholder – only CharSet check, but easily extendable). Accessible in the main window via the 4th ToolButton in the toolbar.
! Source directory restructured: New structure improves overall clarity.
! Source code revised: Application should now run more stable overall.

! Changed: Relocation of Turbobird.reg and Query History file to src/data/config for multi-instance configurations.
! Changed: Configuration handling now allows multiple TurboBird instances for different Firebird versions simultaneously, simplifying testing and database migration from older versions.
